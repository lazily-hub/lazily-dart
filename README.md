# lazily (Dart)

Lazy reactive primitives for Dart — **Slots, Cells, and Signals** with automatic
dependency tracking and cache invalidation. Pure Dart: Flutter, web, and native.

A port of the lazily reactive family ([`lazily-rs`][rs], [`lazily-py`][py],
[`lazily-js`][js], [`lazily-zig`][zig]).

## The reactive family

- **Slot** — a lazily-computed cached value that automatically tracks its
  dependencies and recomputes only when read after an upstream change.
- **Cell** — a mutable source value that invalidates dependent Slots/Signals
  when it changes.
- **Signal** — an *eager* derived value that recomputes the instant a dependency
  changes, with no intermediate unset value.

Values are **lazy by default**. When you need eager push-style semantics, reach
for `Signal`.

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:lazily/lazily.dart';

final ctx = Context();
final a = Cell<int>(ctx, 2);
final b = Cell<int>(ctx, 3);

// Lazy: computes on first read, caches, recomputes only when a or b changes.
final sum = Slot<int>(ctx, (_) => a.value + b.value);
print(sum()); // 5

a.value = 10;
print(sum()); // 13

// Eager: recomputes immediately when a dependency changes.
final parity = Signal<String>(ctx, (_) => a.value.isEven ? 'even' : 'odd');
print(parity.value); // even
a.value = 11;
print(parity.value); // odd (already updated before the read)
```

A [Cell] also supports persistent observers (the hook for Flutter
`ValueNotifier` bridges and `setState` wrappers):

```dart
final count = Cell<int>(ctx, 0);
final dispose = count.subscribe((v) => print('now $v'));
count.value = 1; // prints "now 1"
dispose();
```

## Context

All reactives that react to each other must share a `Context`. The context
holds an identity-keyed cache and the computation stack used for automatic
dependency tracking. One context per reactive graph is the contract.

## State machine

`StateMachine` is a finite state machine backed by a `Cell`, so any slot or
signal that reads `state` is invalidated on transition:

```dart
final m = StateMachine<String, String>(
  ctx, 'Red',
  (s, e) => e == 'advance'
      ? const {'Red': 'Green', 'Green': 'Yellow', 'Yellow': 'Red'}[s]
      : null,
);
m.send('advance'); // true -> 'Green'
```

## State chart

`StateChart` is a full Harel/SCXML **hierarchical** state machine — the native
counterpart of [`lazily-formal`][formal]'s `LazilyFormal.StateChart` and
lazily-rs's / lazily-kt's state charts. It is **compute, not protocol**: it is
never serialized as a distinct wire kind. The active configuration lives in a
`Cell`, so any slot or signal reading `configuration`, `activeLeaves`, or
`matches` is invalidated on a real transition; a no-op (configuration
unchanged) is suppressed by the cell's structural-equality guard.

`send` is deterministic by construction — a total function of
`(chart, configuration, history, guards, event)`, mirroring the Lean
`StateChart.send`. A chart is built from the declarative JSON form
(`lazily-spec/docs/state-charts.md`) via `ChartDef.fromJson`.

Implemented subset (per the spec's implementation-status note): compound
(hierarchical) states with default initial descent, orthogonal (parallel)
regions, shallow **and** deep history (record-on-exit / restore-on-enter),
entry/exit/transition actions (exit innermost-first → transition → entry
outermost-first), named guards resolved at `send` time (fail-closed), and
external + internal transitions. `run` actions and `{"expr": …}` context
guards are rejected explicitly. `final` states are accepted as leaves without
raising completion (`done`) events, matching lazily-py and lazily-kt.

```dart
import 'package:lazily/lazily.dart';

final def = ChartDef.fromJson({
  'initial': 'on',
  'states': {
    'root': {'initial': 'on'},
    'on': {
      'parent': 'root', 'initial': 'playing',
      'on': {'toggle': 'off'},           // handled by 'on', bubbles from a child
    },
    'playing': {'parent': 'on', 'on': {'pause': 'paused'}},
    'paused':  {'parent': 'on', 'on': {'play': 'playing'}},
    'off':     {'parent': 'root', 'on': {'toggle': 'on'}},  // re-enters -> 'playing'
  },
});
final chart = StateChart(ctx, def);

chart.activeLeaves();            // ['playing']
chart.send('toggle');            // true; off -> on -> playing (initial)
chart.matches('on');             // true
chart.lastActions();             // exit → transition → entry actions
```

## Conformance

lazily-dart replays the shared [`lazily-spec`][spec] conformance fixtures:

- State-chart fixtures mirrored into `test/conformance/statechart/` are
  replayed by `test/statechart_conformance_test.dart`, asserting `accepted`,
  `active`, `matches`, and `actions` identically to every other binding
  (lazily-rs / lazily-kt / lazily-py / lazily-zig / lazily-js). When the
  sibling `lazily-spec` checkout is present on disk, the canonical fixtures are
  preferred, so this harness also guards against cross-family drift.

### Formal model (`lazily-formal`)

`dart test` also builds the [`lazily-formal`][formal] Lean 4 model — the
executable reference behind the state-chart fixtures and the deterministic
`send` lazily-dart inherits. `tool/formal_check.dart` runs `lake build` over
the sibling `lazily-formal` checkout (located via the `LAZILY_FORMAL_PATH` env
var, then the `src/lazily-dart` ↔ `src/lazily-formal` submodule layout); it
SKIPs gracefully when the submodule or the `lake` toolchain is absent — so
pub.dev consumers and shallow clones are not broken. CI uses a full checkout +
[elan](https://github.com/leanprover/lean-action), so the proofs are verified
for real there.

Each lazily-formal module that has a Dart counterpart has a matching
property test that names the universal theorem it mirrors — the guarantees no
finite fixture suite can establish:

| lazily-formal module | Dart test file | Mirrored theorems |
|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| `StateMachine` / `StateChart` | `test/statechart_properties_test.dart` | `enabled_empty_rejects`, `send_preserves_chart`, determinism-by-construction, `single_region_refines_flat_machine`, `single_region_enabled_at_most_one`, `parallel_region_confluence`, `recordHistory_idempotent`, `send_actions_empty_when_rejected` |
| `Reactive` | `test/reactive_properties_test.dart` | `setCell_equal_preserves_graph`, `setCell_different_invalidates_dependents`, `recomputeSlot_equal_preserves_dependents`, `recomputeSlot_different_invalidates_dependents`, `signal_materialized_after_recompute` |
| `ThreadSafe` | `test/thread_safe_test.dart` | `flushBatch_singleton_eq_setCell`, `flushBatch_dependent_dirty`, `flushBatch_preserves_nondependent_dirty`, coalesced-frontier dedup |
| `Materialization` | `test/thread_safe_reactive_family_test.dart` | `materialize_present_comm`, `materialize_observe_comm` (confluence), `materialize_preserves_observe` |
| `AsyncMaterialization` | `test/async_reactive_family_test.dart` | `eventual_transparency`, `async_resolved_matches_sync`, `observe_pending_is_none`, `cell_resolved_at_build`, `resolve_monotone` |
| `FamilySync` | `test/familysync_conformance_test.dart` | `applyOp_absent_adopts`, `present_merge`, `applyOp_idem`, `aggregate_converges` |

## lazily-spec IPC

The `package:lazily/ipc.dart` library implements the language-agnostic
lazily-spec wire protocol (`Snapshot`, `Delta`, `NodeState`, ...) so a Dart
graph's state can be mirrored to remote observers across processes and
languages. It round-trips the canonical fixtures from
[`lazily-spec`][spec]/`conformance/`.

## Benchmarks

Wall-clock benchmarks live in [`BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md), with two
runnable programs:

- **Micro-benchmarks** — the in-library `runBenchmarkSuite` reactive-core,
  collection, and CRDT paths (`Cell`/`Slot`/`Memo`/`batch`/`CellMap`/`TextCrdt`/
  `SeqCrdt`). The reactive-core steady state is sub-microsecond per op.
- **Scale** — a spreadsheet-shaped graph (`N` input cells + `N` formula slots,
  `formula[i] = input[i] + input[i-1]`) replicating the lazily-rs `scale` group
  and lazily-go. It runs a **full 10M-cell Google Sheets workbook**
  (`N = 5,000,000`): build ~2.5 s, full cold recompute ~4 s, and a one-cell edit
  + bounded-viewport read stays **size-independent at ~30 µs** (~136,000×
  cheaper than a full recalc) — only the ~2 dependent formulas recompute.

```bash
dart run benchmark/micro_benchmark.dart
dart run benchmark/scale_benchmark.dart                          # N = 1,000,000 (~2M nodes)
LAZILY_SCALE_N=5000000 dart run benchmark/scale_benchmark.dart   # 10M cells (Google Sheets workbook)
```

See [`BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md) for the measured results, hardware, and
methodology.

## Status

**Full feature parity on the Dart platform** — every row of the lazily-spec
cross-language matrix is shipped (`✅`), including the concurrency layers.

Dart isolates have no shared mutable heap, so the "thread-safe" layers are
realized the same way JavaScript ships them on its single-realm event loop:
within an isolate, synchronous code runs to completion and already serializes
access, so `ThreadSafeContext` / `ThreadSafeReactiveMap` use a **reentrant
run-to-completion guard** and the deterministic batch-coalescing kernel proven
equivalent to `LazilyFormal.ThreadSafe`. Genuine cross-isolate parallelism is
served by (a) `TransferableTypedData` for the **zero-copy shared-memory blob
path** (`ShmBlobArena.transfer`, a zero-copy move — Dart's isolate-model
counterpart of `mmap`/`SharedArrayBuffer`) and (b) the CRDT wire protocol for
replicated state — reconciled with materialization confluence under real
multi-isolate workloads (`test/shm_isolate_test.dart`).

## Keyed cell collections

There is **one** keyed primitive, `ReactiveMap<K, V, H>`, generic over the
entry's handle kind `H`, with two specializations (`#reactivemap`):

- `CellMap<K, V>` = `ReactiveMap<K, V, Cell<V>>` — **input-cell** entries; adds
  cell-only `set` plus eager value-minting (`entry` / `entryWith`).
- `SlotMap<K, V>` = `ReactiveMap<K, V, Slot<V>>` — **derived-slot** entries;
  `getOrInsertWith` mints a slot on first access (**lazy materialization**),
  `materializeAll` pre-mints the keyset (**eager**). A slot's value is derived,
  so `SlotMap` has **no `set`**, and there is **no eager/lazy mode flag**.

The shared surface (`getOrInsertWith` / `remove` / `move*` / membership / order /
`keys` / `len` / `containsKey`) lives on `ReactiveMap`.

`CellMap<K, V>` is a **composition of cells**, not a new cell kind. Each entry
is an ordinary `Cell`; a dedicated membership cell tracks the key set, and a
dedicated order cell tracks the ordered key list, so the three reactivity
planes are independent:

- writing one entry's value invalidates **only** that entry's value readers;
- adding/removing a key invalidates membership readers (`len` / `containsKey`)
  and order readers (`keys`), but **not** unrelated entry value readers;
- a pure reorder (atomic move) invalidates order readers only.

```dart
final ctx = Context();
final scores = CellMap<String, int>(ctx)
  ..set('alice', 10)
  ..set('bob', 20);

final leaderboard = Slot<List<String>>(ctx, (_) => scores.keys());
leaderboard(); // ['alice', 'bob']

scores.moveTo('bob', 0);
leaderboard(); // ['bob', 'alice']  — recomputed (order changed)
```

`reconcileDiff` is the move-minimized keyed reconciliation (`#lzkeyrecon`):
diffs two keyed sequences by stable key and emits the minimal
`{insert, remove, move, update}` op set, holding the longest-increasing
subsequence fixed so keys already in relative order do not move.

`CellTree<K, V>` is the ordered keyed tree — each node is
`(stable id, value cell, ordered keyed child collection)`, inheriting per-level
reactivity and the atomic-move guarantee.

## Distributed CRDT plane

The CRDT plane rides the same lazily-ipc transport as `Snapshot`/`Delta`:
`CrdtSync` is a third `IpcMessage` variant. State-based and idempotent —
out-of-order, duplicated, or batched delivery all converge.

```dart
import 'package:lazily/ipc.dart';

final a = CrdtPlane(1);
final stamp = a.tick(12345);                              // local event
final op = CrdtOp.newOp(nodeId, stamp, [1, 2, 3]);        // state to merge
final frame = CrdtSync(
  frontier: a.frontier.toWire(),                          // per-peer stamp frontier
  ops: [op],
);
// → IpcMessage.ofCrdtSync(frame).encodeJson()  is the wire form.
```

`StampFrontier.merge` is commutative, associative, idempotent; the
causal-stability watermark (`stabilityWatermark`) is the `min` over
membership — only once every replica has observed a tombstone may it be
collected (`isCollectable`).

## FFI boundary

`package:lazily/ffi.dart` exposes `LazilyFfiBytes`, `LazilyFfiStatus`, and
`LazilyFfiMessageKind` (with `CrdtSync = 3`). A frame is just serialized
`IpcMessage` bytes; the channel decodes each accepted frame as `IpcMessage`
and re-encodes canonical JSON.

```dart
import 'package:lazily/ffi.dart';
import 'package:lazily/ipc.dart';

final frame = LazilyFfiBytes(IpcMessage.ofCrdtSync(sync).encodeJson());
final c = lazilyFfiKindJson(frame);
expect(c.kind, LazilyFfiMessageKind.crdtSync);
```

lazily-dart declares the **`ffi = host`** capability (Dart has `dart:ffi`).

## Capability negotiation

`package:lazily/capability.dart` ships the compatibility handshake. Peers fail
closed on `protocol_id`, `protocol_major_version`, `codec`,
`ordered_reliable`, or a required feature the other does not offer.

## Async reactive context

`package:lazily/async_context.dart` is a separate reactive surface for
`async`/future-returning computations, with the full
`Empty → Computing → Resolved | Error` state machine, revision tracking (stale
completions discarded), in-flight deduplication, the re-resolve contract, an
equality `memoAsync` guard, serialized async effects (cleanup-before-body),
batching, and disposal.

## Development

```bash
dart pub get
dart analyze --fatal-infos
dart test
```

`dart test` builds [`lazily-formal`][formal] (Lean proofs) when the sibling
submodule + `lake` toolchain are present, and SKIPs otherwise. To verify the
proofs in a standalone clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lazily-hub/lazily-formal.git ../lazily-formal
# (or) set LAZILY_FORMAL_PATH=/path/to/lazily-formal
dart run tool/formal_check.dart
```
